## üéØ Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between **cryptocurrency trader performance** and **Bitcoin market sentiment** using the Fear/Greed Index. By examining historical trading data from Hyperliquid alongside sentiment indicators, we derive actionable insights for algorithmic trading strategy development.

### üîç Research Questions
- How does market sentiment (Fear vs Greed) impact trader profitability?
- Do traders change their behavior during extreme sentiment periods?
- Which accounts consistently outperform across different sentiment regimes?
- Can sentiment-based strategies provide trading advantages?

## üèÜ Key Findings

### üí∞ **Profitability Insights**
- **Sentiment Impact**: Clear correlation between market sentiment and trading performance
- **Optimal Regimes**: Certain sentiment periods show significantly higher average returns
- **Risk-Reward**: Trading behavior varies dramatically across sentiment classifications

### üìä **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Position Sizing**: Traders adjust trade sizes based on market sentiment
- **Trading Direction**: Buy/sell ratios fluctuate with Fear/Greed levels
- **Fee Patterns**: Transaction costs vary across sentiment regimes
- **Temporal Effects**: Hourly trading patterns differ by sentiment

### üé≤ **Strategic Opportunities**
- **Contrarian Strategies**: Some accounts consistently profit during extreme sentiment
- **Momentum Plays**: Trend-following opportunities during sentiment transitions
- **Risk Management**: Sentiment-adaptive position sizing shows promise
